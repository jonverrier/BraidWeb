## General info
A front end to the BraidEng app - multi-user access to a GPT prompt, backed by a store of AI documents.

The Braid Engine is an AI-enabled Learning Management System (LMS). The objective is to be able to build a curriculum of content by processing open-source documents from the web (YouTube videos, GitHub repositories, and plan HTML text) and loading AI generated summaries into a document store. A simple front end then enables students to navigate through the content, can answer questions based on the embedded content, and recommend next steps once the student is familiar with a certain level of content. 

The specific domain is to teach students how to build AI applications using modern Large Language Model (LLM) technology, and the current approaches to this - Retrieval Assisted Generation (RAG), and multi-step workflows using the LLM to generate summaries and process questions.

The benefits of this approach are:
- It is simple to maintain content, given that the field is moving so rapidly. Traditional approaches of generating bespoke new content are often obsolete by the time they are ready. 
- Students get a flavour of what is possible with modern AI by using the tools.
